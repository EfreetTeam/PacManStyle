In main method:
created new int lives = 3;
Added check if gamerunning == false and there are lives left, gamerunning = true.

In DrawEndScreen method:
Has new parameter: int score;
Contains temporarily end game screen(taken from the CheckIfBotHitPlayer method).

In DrawPlayerInfo method:
Has new parameter: int lives;
Now prints the remaining lives of the player.

ChechIfBotHitPlayer method:
Now only checks if the player and the bot collided: Now does not print the end screen.

*Bug: When the player and a bot collide, the symbol of the bot remains on the spot of the collision. Any ideas how to fix this?
